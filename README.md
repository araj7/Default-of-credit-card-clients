# Default-of-credit-card-clients
This project was created with the purpose of analysis and prediction making of the Default of credit card clients Data Set from UCI Machine Learning Library. Using the models we created, we I've tried to predict the class value of dpnm column with better accuracy and f1 score than the scores presented in the original paper.

**Logistic Regression, K Nearest, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes - Gaussian NB and Neural Network has been used to perform the classification**
